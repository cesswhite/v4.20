## 🔧 Pinia SSR Configuration

This template includes a pre-configured Pinia store with **SSR hydration** support:

- **Hydration Strategy**: Ignores initial state and reads values from browser (localStorage)
- **SSR Compatibility**: Properly handles server-side rendering with client-side state
- **TypeScript Note**: Uses `@ts-expect-error` due to [Pinia type system limitation](https://github.com/vuejs/pinia/issues/2086#issuecomment-1493942501)
